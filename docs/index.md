# Sec-certs documentation

There are three main parts of this documentation. *User's guide* describes high-level use of our tool. Driven by this knowledge, you can progress to *Notebook examples* that showcase most of the API that we use in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The documentation currently does not have all modules documented with `autodoc`, so for the API reference, you must directly inspect the [sec_certs](https://github.com/crocs-muni/sec-certs/tree/main/sec_certs) module. If you want, you can run the notebooks as they are stored in the [project repository](https://github.com/crocs-muni/sec-certs/tree/main/notebooks). If you are interested in contributing to our project or in other aspects of our development, you can consult the relevant *GitHub artifacts*
